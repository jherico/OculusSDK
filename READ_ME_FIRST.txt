Oculus VR Rift SDK README

Congratulations on downloading the Oculus VR Rift SDK.

If you have not done so, be sure to download and install the Oculus Rift Runtime from 
the 0.4 tab at http://developer.oculusvr.com/downloads.

The Runtime must be installed before running any apps built using Oculus Rift SDK 0.4 (DK1 or DK2).
It should be installed to improve the DK1 experience when running apps older than SDK version 0.3.

If you have any questions or comments, please visit http://developer.oculusvr.com/forums.

We hope you enjoy your VR experience!
