Full-length Legal Copy:

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the "License"), 
Oculus VR, LLC ("Oculus VR") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, 
reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the 
software contained in this Oculus VR Rift Software Development Kit ("RIFT SDK"), 
including, but not limited to, the samples, headers, LibOVR headers, and LibOVR 
source.  This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:

1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the RIFT 
SDK to make applications, content, games and demos (collectively and generally 
referred to as "Developer Content") that run on the Oculus VR approved mobile hardware 
and software products ("Oculus Approved Rift Products") and which may incorporate 
the RIFT SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the 
RIFT SDK to create derivative works of the RIFT SDK itself ("RIFT SDK Derivatives"), 
whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third 
party software unless otherwise noted.  

1.2.  RIFT SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code 
derived exclusively from the RIFT SDK by you; provided, however, that RIFT SDK 
Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, 
content, games or demos) which may be developed using the RIFT SDK.  By way of example 
a mobile application or game or demo that is developed using the RIFT SDK would not 
be a RIFT SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game 
engine that is adapted to work with the RIFT SDK be a RIFT SDK Derivative. 
By way of example, but not limitation, a RIFT SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i) 
an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the RIFT SDK to improve efficiency; 
or (ii) an addition of code or improvement to the RIFT SDK that adds functionality. 

1.3  For the sake of clarification when you use the RIFT SDK (including RIFT SDK 
Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer 
Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including 
your source and object code) to Oculus VR or any third parties; provided, however, 
Oculus VR retains all rights to the RIFT SDK and the RIFT SDK Derivatives that may 
be incorporated into your Developer Content.

1.4  You agree to and you will use  the Flash Screen Warning and the Health and 
Safety Warnings (collectively the "Oculus Warnings") and the Oculus VR health and 
safety protocols found in the Oculus Best Practices Guide ("Oculus H&S Protocols"), 
and your use of the Oculus Warnings and the Oculus end user license agreement 
("Oculus EULA") with your Developer Content as provided for in the Oculus Developer 
Center, all of which can be found at the following link:  
https://developer.oculusvr.com/?action=doc.

2. You, the recipient and user of the RIFT SDK, hereby agree and accept that that
Oculus VR shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property 
rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any 
RIFT SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such 
rights to such RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR, subject to the following.

2.1  We hereby grant to you the a fully paid up, no-charge, royalty-free, 
world-wide, in perpetuity, non-exclusive right and license back to use these RIFT 
SDK Derivatives solely in conjunction with the RIFT SDK (or any components of the 
RIFT SDK) and/or Developer Content on Oculus Rift Products as set forth herein.

2.2  Furthermore, for the sake of clarification, Oculus VR and its assignees and 
licensees shall be free to use such RIFT SDK Derivatives without any approval 
from you and without compensation or attribution to you.

2.3  You also agree upon Oculus VR's request to provide the source and binary code 
of any RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST 
IS THE BASIS FOR AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE BY OCULUS VR.

3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, your license to redistribute 
and sublicense the RIFT SDK and RIFT SDK Derivatives is also expressly made 
subject to the following conditions:

3.1. You may sublicense and redistribute the source, binary, or object code of 
the RIFT SDK in whole or in part by itself for no charge or as part of a for charge 
piece of Developer Content; provided, however, you may only license, sublicense 
or redistribute the source, binary or object code of LibOVR in whole, and you may 
not license, sublicense or redistribute any portion or element of LibOVR separately 
or in part (in either source, binary or object form). If you license, sublicense 
or redistribute RIFT SDK Derivatives in and of themselves (not as a part of a 
piece of Developer Content) then you may only do that solely with and in conjunction 
with either the RIFT SDK or LibOVR. The RIFT SDK (including, but not limited to 
LibOVR), any RIFT SDK Derivatives, and any Developer Content may only be used 
with Oculus Approved Rift Products and may not be used, licensed, or sublicensed 
to interface with mobile software or hardware or other commercial headsets, 
mobile tablets or phones that are not authorized and approved by Oculus VR;

3.2. You must include with all such redistributed or sublicensed RIFT SDK 
or RIFT SDK Derivatives code the following copyright notice: 
"Copyright © 2014 Oculus VR, LLC. All rights reserved," and include the 
list of conditions contained in this Section 3, including the full text of 
the disclaimer in Section 3.6 below;

3.3. Neither the name of Oculus VR, LLC nor the names of Oculus VR, LLC's 
contributors, licensors, employees, or contractors, may be used to endorse or promote 
products derived from this RIFT SDK without specific prior written permission 
of Oculus VR, LLC;

3.4. You must give any other recipients of the RIFT SDK or any elements thereof, 
including LibOVR or RIFT SDK Derivatives, a copy of this License as such recipients,

or any elements thereof subject to the terms of this Licence and such recipients, 
licensees or sublicensees agreement and acceptance of this License with Oculus VR 
(which will convey all rights to the recipients’ or licensees’ or sublicensees’ 
RIFT SDK Derivatives to Oculus VR), and you must cause any modified files to 
carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files;

3.5. If the RIFT SDK or a specific element thereof such as LibOVR includes a 
"LICENSE" text file as part of its distribution (the "License Notice"), then 
any RIFT SDK Derivatives that you distribute with the RIFT SDK in whole or in 
part must include a readable copy of such attribution notices as are contained 
within the applicable License Notice file (excluding those notices that do not 
pertain to any part of the RIFT SDK Derivatives), in at least one of the following 
places: within a License Notice text file distributed as part of the RIFT SDK 
Derivatives; within the source form or documentation, if provided along with 
the RIFT SDK Derivatives; or, within a display generated by the RIFT SDK Derivatives, 
if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.  You must also include 
in the License Notice file for all RIFT SDK Derivatives a copy of all notices 
(including any product liability or health and safety notices).  The contents 
of the License Notice file are for informational purposes only and do not modify 
the License. You may add your own attribution notices within RIFT SDK Derivatives 
that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the License Notice text from 
the RIFT SDK or any part thereof, provided that such additional attribution notices 
cannot be construed as modifying the License.

ITS CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL OCULUS VR AS THE 
COPYRIGHT OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, 
OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS RIFT 
SDK OR THE RIFT SDK DERIVATIVES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

4. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
service marks, or product names of Oculus VR, except as required for reasonable 
and customary use in describing the origin of the RIFT SDK, LibOVR, or any 
element thereof, and reproducing the content of the License Notice file. 
Oculus VR reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under this License.

5. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), 
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as 
deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Oculus VR 
or any contributor be liable to you or your licensees or sublicensees for 
damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential 
damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use 
or inability to use the RIFT SDK, LibOVR, any element thereof or any RIFT SDK 
Derivatives (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if you or such contributor has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.

6.  Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License in and of 
itself and for all Developer Content created as of March 1, 2014, may be 
evidenced by any of the following: your usage of the RIFT SDK or any element 
thereof, acceptance of the click-through agreement, or opening the packaging 
of the CD-ROM containing the RIFT SDK or any element thereof, including LibOVR.  
As this License is updated for future releases of the RIFT SDK and/or LibOVR, 
you agree to abide by and meet all requirements of future updates of this 
License for those future RIFT SDK releases as evidenced by the same usage of 
the RIFT SDK or any element thereof and the future updates of this License 
will apply for that future Developer Content that may developed for or with 
that future RIFT SDK or any element thereof (i.e., you cannot sidestep out 
of the requirements of future updates of the License by developing against 
an older release of the RIFT SDK or License). 

7.  Oculus VR reserves the right to terminate this License and all your 
rights hereunder in the event you materially breach this License and fail

from Oculus VR.  

8.  Furthermore, Oculus VR also reserves the right to cancel or terminate 
this License for any of the following reasons upon notice to you, subject 
to the appeal process set forth in Section 14 for a wrongful termination: 

	a) Intellectual property infringement by you with Developer Content 
	or RIFT SDK Derivatives created by you that is used with or by the 
	RIFT SDK or any part thereof, or any of the RIFT SDK Derivatives;
	
	b) Developer Content that violates or infringes upon applicable law;

usage of the License after such amendments or changes signifies your consent 
to and acceptance of any such amendments or changes on a going forward basis.

10.   In the event any provision of this License is determined to be invalid, 
prohibited or unenforceable by a court or other body of competent jurisdiction, 
this License shall be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable 
provision has been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or 
unenforceable.  

11.   You may not assign any rights or obligations under this License without 
the advance written consent of Oculus VR, which may be withheld in its sole 
discretion.  Oculus VR may assign its rights or obligations under this License 
in its sole discretion.

13.   Your remedies under this License shall be limited to the right to collect 
money damages, if any, and you hereby waive your right to injunctive or other 
equitable relief.

before a neutral arbitrator in Orange County, California.  If your License 
has been terminated hereunder by Oculus, you may appeal your termination 
through this arbitration process on an expedited basis with an arbitration 
within thirty days of your giving Oculus VR notice of the appeal.  The

of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final 
and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction.  You agree 
to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Orange

or decision or any dispute with respect to the arbitration process or procedure 
or Oculus VR’s exercise of its equitable rights or remedies.
