Oculus SDK 0.4.1 Release Notes - Runtime Rev 1
----------------------------------------------

After installing the SDK, update the Oculus DK2 firmware
to the most recent version, 2.11. The Firmware update dialog can be found under
"Tools / Advanced / Update Firmware..." menu of the Oculus Configuration
Utility. If you experience any issues, please refer to the Troubleshooting
and Known Issues sections below.


New SDK Features
----------------

* Added “Pause Service...” option to the Configuration Utility, which temporarily
  releases DK2 sensor, allowing 0.3.x SDK applications to run.

* Added Mac OS support. Mac does not currently include a display driver, so it
  always works in Extend Desktop mode.

* Added ovr_InitializeRenderingShim function that can be used to hook rendering,
  needed for Direct to HMD Mode, without spinning up the rest of LibOVR.



Bug Fixes since 0.4.0
---------------------

* Removed SSE4.1 requirement that was problematic for some older AMD CPUs.
* Fixed OpenGL support on AMD cards in direct mode.
* Resolved Blue Screen (BSOD) that happened starting some demos
  with some video adapters.
* Fixed BSOD or boot-up Black screen issued caused by interaction with Display Link.
  Display Link still need to be uninstalled for OVR direct mode to work.
* Improved OpenGL support in the driver shim.

Unity
* Fixed shadows and some Unity shaders by switching back to a symmetric
  frustum for rendering.
* Fixed D3D11 rendering.
* Miscellaneous improvements in stability and timewarp precision.



Troubleshooting
---------------

The most likely issues you may experience with DK2 is scene Judder and Vsync tearing.
Here we describe these issues and provide advice on addressing them.

* Scene Judder - The whole view jitters as you look around, producing a strobing
  back-and-forth effect. This effect is the result of skipping frames (or Vsync)
  on a low-persistence display, it will usually be noticeable on DK2 when frame rate
  falls below 75 FPS. This is often the result of insufficient GPU performance or
  attempting to render too complex of a scene. Optimizing the engine or scene content
  should help.
  
  We expect the situation to improve in this area as we introduce asynchronous
  timewarp and other optimizations over the next few months. 
  If you experience this on DK2 with multiple monitors attached, please try 
  disabling one monitor to see if the problem goes away.

* VSync tear - A vertical tear line appears in one of the eyes of the display.
  This is the result of vsync timing being done incorrectly in either our display
  driver or Windows composition. Disabling one of the monitors, disabling windows
  composition, or switching the Oculus driver mode may help. We are working on
  resolving vsync issue across in future releases.



0.4.1 Rev 1 Known Issues - LibOVR and Display Driver
----------------------------------------------------

* Monitors in multiple display configurations will blink when activating the Rift.

* Intel hardware as a single GPU configuration is generally too slow to run
  VR scenes with DK2. The most obvious effect will be judder.

* Using duplicated displays in Windows will lead to display driver restart
  when activating the Rift. The work around is use to use Extend Desktop mode.

* Nvidia Optimus GPU configurations are not universally supported.
  Some Windows 7 and 8 configurations were tested successfully.
  Windows 8.1 is more likely to have issues.

* Use of both DK1 and DK2 at the same time is not supported.

* DK2 display may fail to work if plugged in after DK1 was unplugged and used in
  Direct Mode. When this happens, status LED will blink with alternating
  yellow-blue pattern. The work around is to switch to Extended Desktop mode and back.

* Open GL rendering can have vsync tear with Nvidida cards in Extended Desktop mode.
  Try direct Display Mode.

* On some Radeon graphics cards, multisampling may cause scene judder.
  The work wound is to turn-off multi-sampling for the back buffer.

* Updates on another monitor may interfere with vsync timing on the Rift and this can
  manifest  as visible tearing in the Rift. This can be eliminated in Windows 7 by 
  disabling Windows composition.

* Locking the screen in Windows will cause Oculus Rift applications to lose tracking.
  
* It is necessary to restart the Config Util after updating the Headset firmware.

* Camera bound menu option is shown in Config Util Demo Scene for DK1. It has no
  effect when a DK1 is connected.

* Sample renderer doesn't and OWD sample does not honor Multisampling
  setting in OpenGL.

* The runtime installer does not support downgrading to previous versions
  of the installer.  If you need to go back to a previous version, first
  uninstall the current version and then install the previous one.


Known Issues - Unity
--------------------

* Unity app latency on Mac is higher than in C++ OWD resulting in slightly swimmy display.

* Direct Mode Unity apps may judder on multi-monitor configurations.
  Please try disconnecting one monitor as a work-around.

* Unity applications built with DX11 support may crash at exit.
  Use DX9 where possible.

* OpenGL in Direct mode is not functional in Unity.


Known Issues - UE4
------------------

* UE4: OpenGL is not supported on Windows in current release.

* UE4: Direct Mode sometimes does not Vsync correctly.
