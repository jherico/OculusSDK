Oculus SDK 0.4.0 Release Notes - Runtime Rev 1
----------------------------------------------

After installing the SDK, update the Oculus DK2 firmware
to the most recent version 2.11. Firmware update dialog can be found under
"Tools / Advanced / Update Firmware..." menu of the Oculus Configuration
Utility. If you experience any issues, please refer to the Troubleshooting
and Known Issues sections below.


New SDK Features
----------------

* Added DK2 Positional Tracking support.

* Introduced Oculus Runtime that is installed separately from the SDK.
  Runtime package includes the Oculus Config Utility, service and drivers.

* Oculus SDK now relies on OVRService resident process that communicates
  to hardware, handling tracking and sensor fusion. The service allows
  multiple processes to access headset tracking data simultaneously.

* Added Health and Safety Warning screen that should be displayed on application
  startup. SDK Rendering mode automatically displays the screen, providing APIs
  to dismiss it. In Application Rendering mode, developers are responsible for
  implementing their own warning based on Oculus bitmap.
  
* Added ovrHmd_GetHSWDisplayState and ovrHmd_DismissHSWDisplay APIs for
  controlling rendering and timing of the safety warning.
  
* Introduced Oculus Display Driver under Windows that routes rendering output
  directly to the Rift. Driver settings can be changed in the Oculus Config Utility.
  
* Added the ovrHmdCap_ExtendDesktop flag that indicates that headset is operating
  in extend desktop (backwards compatible) mode. If this flag is set, Oculus
  display driver is disabled.
  
* Added ovrHmd_AttachToWindow function used to direct window swap chain output
  to the Rift through the display driver.
  
* Added ovrHmdCap_NoMirrorToWindow option, which disabled mirroring of headset output
  to a window (enabled by default). Disabling mirroring improves performance.
  
* Added display luminance overdrive option that reduces screen ghosting effect on DK2.
  This is implemented as an extra pass in SDK Rendered mode, enabled by the ovrDistortionCap_Overdrive flag.
  
* Added CameraPose and LeveledCameraPose data to ovrTrackingState, allowing
  users to identify location of the external camera. This data can be used to
  detect when players approach the edge of the tracking volume.
  
* Added ovrHmd_RecenterPose function, used to re-initialize positional tracking
  origin based on the current location.
  
* Added RawSensorData to ovrTrackingState, giving access to the raw IMU and
  magnetometer readings.

  
API Changes
-----------
* Various "Sensor" functions and structures were renamed to "Tracking"
  equivalents. For example, ovrSensorState is now ovrTrackingState,
  returned by ovrHmd_GetTrackingState.
  
* ovrHmd is now a pointer to ovrHmdDesc, with relevant members being
  accessible directly. ovrHmd_GetHmdDesc function was removed.  
  
* ovrHmd_StartSensor and ovrHmd_StopSensor functions were removed; please
  use ovrHmd_ConfigureTracking instead.
  
* ovrHmd_BeginEyeRender and ovrHmd_EndEyeRender have been removed;
  texture data is for both eyes is now passed in ovrHmd_EndFrame.
  
* Please refer to the Oculus Developer Guide Appendix A for further details.


Unity Integration Changes
-------------------------
* Exposed all CAPI functionality through OVRHmd.cs wrapper.

* Added TimeWarp to minimize latency.

* Switched to SDK distortion rendering for better quality/performance.

* Added direct-to-Rift rendering support. Just launch "<AppName>_DirectToRift.exe".

* Switched to asymmetric frusta to improve pixel density.

* Fixed issues with viewport management, deferred rendering, and linear lighting.




Troubleshooting
---------------

The most likely issues you may experience with DK2 is scene Judder and Vsync tearing.
Here we describe these issues and provide advice on addressing them.

* Scene Judder - The whole view jitters as you look around, producing a strobing
  back-and-forth effect. This effect is the result of skipping frames (or Vsync)
  on a low-persistence display, it will usually be noticeable on DK2 when frame rate
  falls below 75 FPS. This is often the result of insufficient GPU performance or
  attempting to render too complex of a scene. Optimizing the engine or scene content
  should help.
  
  We expect the situation to improve in this area as we introduce asynchronous
  timewarp and other optimizations over the next few months. 
  If you experience this on DK2 with multiple monitors attached, please try 
  disabling one monitor to see if the problem goes away.

* VSync tear - A vertical tear line appears in one of the eyes of the display.
  This is the result of vsync timing being done incorrectly in either our display
  driver or Windows composition. Disabling one of the monitors, disabling windows
  composition, or switching the Oculus driver mode may help. We are working on
  resolving vsync issue across in future releases.



0.4.0 Rev 1 Known Issues - LibOVR and Display Driver
----------------------------------------------------

* Monitors in multiple display configurations will blink when activating the Rift.

* Intel hardware as a single GPU configuration is generally too slow to run
  VR scenes with DK2. The most obvious effect will be judder.

* Using duplicated displays in Windows will lead to display driver restart
  when activating the Rift. The work around is use to use Extend Desktop mode.

* Nvidia Optimus GPU configurations are not universally supported.
  Some Windows 7 and 8 configurations were tested successfully.
  Windows 8.1 is more likely to have issues.

* Use of both DK1 and DK2 at the same time is not supported.

* DK2 display may fail to work if plugged in after DK1 was unplugged and used in
  Direct Mode. When this happens, status LED will blink with alternating
  yellow-blue pattern. The work around is to switch to Extended Desktop mode and back.

* OpenGL is presently not functional on AMD hardware in Direct Mode.
  Extended desktop mode may be used as a work-around.

* Open GL rendering can have vsync tear with Nvidida cards in Extended Desktop mode.
  Try direct Display Mode.

* On some Radeon graphics cards, multisampling may cause scene judder.
  The work wound is to turn-off multi-sampling for the back buffer.

* Updates on another monitor may interfere with vsync timing on the Rift and this can
  manifest  as visible tearing in the Rift. This can be eliminated in Windows 7 by 
  disabling Windows composition.

* Locking the screen in Windows will cause Oculus Rift applications to lose tracking.
  
* It is necessary to restart the Config Util after updating the Headset firmware.

* Camera bound menu option is shown in Config Util Demo Scene for DK1. It has no
  effect when a DK1 is connected.

* Sample renderer doesn't and OWD sample does not honor Multisampling
  setting in OpenGL.


Known Issues - Unity
--------------------

* Direct Mode Unity apps may judder on multi-monitor configurations.
  Please try disconnecting one monitor as a work-around.

* Unity applications built with DX11 support may crash at exit or on startup 
  the first time they are run. Use DX9 where possible.

* OpenGL in Direct mode is not functional in Unity.


Known Issues - UE4
------------------

* UE4: OpenGL is not supported on Windows in current release.

* UE4: Direct Mode may have significantly lower framerate than Extended Mode.

* UE4: Direct Mode sometimes does not Vsync correctly.
