Oculus SDK 0.4.3 Release Notes - Runtime Rev 1
----------------------------------------------

After installing the SDK, update the Oculus DK2 firmware
to the most recent version, 2.12. The Firmware update dialog can be found under
"Tools / Advanced / Update Firmware..." menu of the Oculus Configuration
Utility. If you experience any issues, please refer to the Troubleshooting
and Known Issues sections below.


New SDK Features
----------------

* Display Driver latency reduction in Direct Mode by 1 frame, resulting in 0ms Post-present.

* Updated display driver to support multi-threaded calls efficiently, this may improve performance in some scenarios.

* New thread-safe function ovrHmd_GetEyePoses() in OVR_CAPI makes it easier for the 
  application to query the two eye (camera) poses by internalizing the HMD-to-eye-offset 
  calculations among other benefits. The ovrHmd_GetEyePose() function is being deprecated.

* Added Pixel Luminance Overdrive support to the OVR_CAPI OpenGL rendering back-end to 
  remove various 2-frame-rise (ghosting) artifacts. This feature is tied to the 
  ovrDistortionCap_Overdrive flag in OVR_CAPI. This effect can be toggled 
  OculusWorldDemo’s option menu.
  
* Added option to re-center starting head position across all applications.
  This is tied to a specific device and serial number and will be shared
  across profiles on the same system.
  
* Added option in the Oculus Configuration Utility to Suppress the Health and Safety Warning
  during active development.  Please see section 7.2 of the Oculus Developer Guide for more 
  information.

* Added option in the Oculus Configuration Utility to set the OVRServer logging level.
  
* Added pop-up error messages when the Rift can't be activated in Direct Display mode.

* Updated the Health and Safety Warning screen to reflect an age restriction of 13. 
  More information can be found in the Oculus VR Best Practices Guide and in the Oculus VR 
  Health And Safety Warnings documentation.
  
Unity
* Overhauled C# API. Reduced performance overhead. See the migration guide for more details.

* Improved support for multi-layered rendering. Just instantiate multiple OVRCameraRigs, set Camera.depth and Camera.clearFlags for each eye, and use.

* Added support for Unity Free in Unity 4.5.5 and up.

* Added support for Unity 5 internal beta.

* Improved performance on all platforms.



Bug Fixes since 0.4.2
---------------------

*  OculusWorldDemo now showcases MSAA the proper way for both D3D10/11 and OpenGL by resolving the multi-sampled buffer before feeding it into the ovrHmd_EndFrame() function.
*  Improved OpenGL state management through contexts
*  Fixes in Vsync direct mode tearing
*  Fixed a bug in the D3D10/11 rendering path that was causing the overall brightness of the visuals to change on some systems.
*  Fix LibOVR build on OSX Yosemite

Unity
*  Fixed a source of jitter in TimeWarp timing that resulted in shaky images.
*  Removed problematic "out of camera range" message. Will be replaced by an optional camera bounds visualization in a future release.
*  In the editor, Game view rendering no longer targets the wrong view.
*  In the editor, Game view rendering no longer breaks when you resize the window or view.


Troubleshooting
---------------

The most likely issues you may experience with DK2 are scene Judder and Vsync tearing.
Here we describe these issues and provide advice on addressing them.

* Scene Judder - The whole view jitters as you look around, producing a strobing
  back-and-forth effect. This effect is the result of skipping frames (or Vsync)
  on a low-persistence display, it will usually be noticeable on DK2 when frame rate
  falls below 75 FPS. This is often the result of insufficient GPU performance or
  attempting to render too complex of a scene. Optimizing the engine or scene content
  should help.
  
  We expect the situation to improve in this area as we introduce asynchronous
  timewarp and other optimizations over the next few months. 
  If you experience this on DK2 with multiple monitors attached, please try 
  disabling one monitor to see if the problem goes away.


0.4.3 Rev 1 Known Issues - LibOVR and Display Driver
----------------------------------------------------

* Monitors in multiple display configurations will blink when activating the Rift.

* Current SDK rendering path includes two GPU/CPU sync points to reduce latency. 
  As may reduce performance due to GPU under-utilization and draw call buffering; 
  we are looking into addressing this in the future.

* The ovrDistortionCap_sRGB flag affects the rendering 
  path in slightly different ways for D3D10/11 and OpenGL, but the differences 
  should not be exposed to the app developer. 
  We will be looking at unifying this path for better visual fidelity.

* Intel hardware as a single GPU configuration is generally too slow to run
  VR scenes with DK2. The most obvious effect will be judder.

* Nvidia Optimus GPU configurations are not universally supported.
  Some Windows 7 and 8 configurations were tested successfully.
  Windows 8.1 is more likely to have issues.

* On some Radeon graphics cards, multisampling may cause scene judder.
  The work around is to turn-off multi-sampling for the back buffer.
  
* The runtime installer does not support downgrading to previous versions
  of the installer.  If you need to go back to a previous version, first
  uninstall the current version and then install the previous one.


Known Issues - Unity
--------------------

* Unity app latency on Mac is higher than in C++ OWD resulting in slightly swimmy display.

* Editor Game view does not yet directly render to the Rift.

* D3D11 in extended mode is unsupported for this release. This configuration will typically appear to judder due to being capped at the 60hz refresh of your primary monitor.

* Forcing Unity to use OpenGL on Windows is unsupported for this release. This configuration is currently unstable and may encounter crashes.
