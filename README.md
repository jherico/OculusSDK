OculusSDK
=========

Oculus SDK with modifications for Linux development and Java development.  The
'master' branch will attempt to track the publicly released SDK version, while
additional branches will be used for my custom modifications.  

All code not explicitly marked with another license is made available under the
terms of the Oculus SDK license, included in this kit as LICENSE.TXT and 
available online at https://developer.oculusvr.com/license and is Copyright 2013

Currently the 'linux' branch contains modifications to the SDK that allow the 
SensorBox sample to function with my local Ubuntu 13.04 distribution.  It is 
currently a work in progress and no guarantee is made that you will be able to 
compile or run the application without significant effort installing dependencies
and or fiddling with Makefiles.  Good luck!
